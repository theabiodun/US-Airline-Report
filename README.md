# U.S. DOT Airline Flight Details Report for 2015

### Project Summary
This Power BI dashboard offers a deep dive into U.S. airline performance, analyzing over 5 million flight records from 2015. The project uncovers patterns in flight delays, cancellation reasons, and peak travel periods, providing an analytical lens into the operational dynamics of the airline industry.

---

### Objectives
- **Data Overview**: Analyze flight volume, cancellations, delays, and airline reliability.
- **Cancellations Analysis**: Identify primary causes of flight cancellations and quantify each reason.
- **Reliability Insights**: Rank airlines based on delay times and assess overall reliability.
- **Travel Patterns**: Visualize monthly and weekly flight volumes to detect peak periods.

### Approach
1. **Data Preparation**:
   - Cleaned and preprocessed the dataset to ensure accuracy and consistency.
   - Created calculated columns and measures in Power BI to derive metrics such as `%Delayed Flights` and `Average Delay Time`.

2. **Visualization & Dashboarding**:
   - Designed a custom dashboard in Power BI with interactive filters for deeper data exploration.
   - Utilized pie charts, line graphs, and bar charts to represent data points effectively.
   - Created tables for quick, comparative insights into delay rates by month and by day of the week.

3. **Key Insights Extraction**:
   - Weather accounted for 54.35% of flight cancellations, highlighting its significant impact on operations.
   - Hawaiian Airlines emerged as the most reliable, while Southwest Airlines faced the most challenges in maintaining schedule reliability.
   - July and August had peak flight volumes, aligning with summer travel trends, with the highest delays typically observed mid-week.

### Key Insights
- **Total Flights**: Over 5.8 million with around 90,000 cancellations.
- **Average Delay**: 33 minutes across all flights.
- **Top Cancellations Reason**: Weather disruptions, causing more than half of all cancellations.
- **Airline Reliability**: Notable variance between airlines; Hawaiian Airlines stands out for punctuality, while others like Southwest Airlines encountered frequent delays.
- **Seasonal Patterns**: High travel demand in July and August, with delays varying by weekday.

### Reflection
This project showcases my ability to manage large datasets and derive actionable insights. Beyond just creating visuals, the dashboard encapsulates a narrative of the operational challenges within the airline industry, from external factors like weather to internal factors influencing airline reliability.

### Dashboard Features
- **Filter Options**: Interactive filters for year, month, day, and airline selection.
- **Insights Panels**: Categorical breakdown of cancellations, delays, and top airlines based on reliability.
- **Performance Metrics**: Immediate display of total flights, delay averages, and other KPIs.

With this analysis, I aimed to provide a holistic view of airline operations, empowering stakeholders to understand and address areas impacting passenger experience and operational efficiency.
